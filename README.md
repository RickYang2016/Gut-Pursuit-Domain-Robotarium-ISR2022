# GUT for Multi-Robot Cooperative Pursuit Strategy

## Abstract
Underlying relationships among multiagent systems (MAS) in hazardous scenarios can be represented as game-theoretic models. In adversarial environments, the adversaries can be intentional or unintentional based on their needs and motivations. Agents will adopt suitable decision-making strategies to maximize their current needs and minimize their expected costs. This paper proposes and extends the new hierarchical network-based model, termed Game-theoretic Utility Tree (GUT), to arrive at a cooperative pursuit strategy to catch an evader in the Pursuit-Evasion game domain. We verify and demonstrate the performance of the proposed method using the [Robotarium platform](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/) compared to the conventional constant bearing (CB) and pure pursuit (PP) strategies. The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the GUT, and the performances validated that the GUT could effectively organize cooperation strategies, helping the group with fewer advantages achieve higher performance.
